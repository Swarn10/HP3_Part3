# Introduction

This folder contains the files related to the custom specification of a pretrained CNN we use to save and load our models. This specification has been written using Google' Protocol Buffers that are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing structured data. This folder contains the specification, C++ and Python libraries generated using the protobuf compiler and the specification, and the translator library used to convert the objects in the specification to operations in the inferencing engine

  

# Explaination of files
* `network.proto`:
	Contains the description of the structure of the network. A network can have multiple layers. We have defined 6 different layers in the file:
	* ConvLayer2D 
	* Activation
	* PoolLayer2D
	* AdaptivePoolLayer2D
	* LinearLayer
	* DropOutLayer

  

* `translator.h & translator.cc`:

 
	Translates the protobuf objects from custom specification to operation objects defined in `forward/operations.h`


* The other files are are auto-generated by protobuf compiler when the specification `network.proto` is compiled and provide the API calls in C++ and Python to load and store objects based on the specification
